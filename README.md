## About

Small application that consumes data from a drinks and cocktails API and returns it in an interface prepared to search by main ingredient and return six drinks at random, offering non-alcoholic ones first (if you drink, don't drive).

It is fully responsive, working correctly on any device, whether mobile, tablet or desktop.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/luisjover/ludusCocktails.git

```

```
npm install

```

```
npm run dev
```


## Future Improvements
- Authenticate the user: I would like to implement a login with Auth0 or some similar tool. Using the login email (login with GitHub) the application is prepared to, with a few simple adaptations, show its own repositories to the user who logs in, instead of mine.
- Replace authentication with Github token with authentication with App: I would like to make the authentication process dynamic, so that you would not have to go to GitHub to generate the access token, replacing it with a JWT, in this case for example Auth0.
- Being able to see the repositories of other users: the two queries (userData and repositoriesData) have been built with variables, so that in the future it would be easy to add a small search engine to see not only my repositories, but those of any user.
- Implement tests
- Implement StoryBook and create variants for components
